### Information collected and what we use it for

I run [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) analytics on omscs.gilani.me. According to the [docs](https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy), following information is collected:


>The following information is collected:

>    Screen size.
>    Country name based on IP address.
>    A hash of the IP address, User-Agent, and random number.

>No personal information (such as IP address) is collected; a hash of the IP address, User-Agent, and a random number (“salt”) is kept in the process memory for 8 hours at the most to identify a browsing session.
>
>The exception to this are requests which are deemed to be coming from a bot, in which case the IP address will be stored temporarily for the purpose of blocking botnets, hosting providers, and other types of abuse.
